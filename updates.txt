V2.0 evaluation:
    1 - update language adapter 
        -> angles are correct for radians
        -> updated terms to include 'close hauled' 
        -> optimal angle between 0.5 and 1 (or -0.5 and -1)
    2 - sub-goal position matching should be rounded to 1 decimal place
        -> updated engine observation to be x:2dp and angle:1dp
    3 - new env without supervised reward for comparison 
        -> systematic eval
        -> added local_config parameter
    4 - Evaluate Engine vs Language form
        -> no easy way to encode prior action to default form
    5 - Instr search not correctly fixing start_obs
        -> for now, limit start x = 0 for simplicity
        -> also makes training results comparable
        -> use repeats instead of seeds
    6 - Updated language adapter V2
        -> added harbor or beach sides instead of left/right
